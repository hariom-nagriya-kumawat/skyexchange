                                promoting responsible gambling practices.</p>

                                responsibility for our product line-up.</p>

                            <p>The aim of Skyfair.vip is to provide the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform for adults. The offered clear and safe
                                products allow each user to play within his financial means and to receive the highest quality service. Integrity, fairness and
                                reliability are the guiding principles of Skyfair.vip’s work. It is therefore clear that Skyfair.vip should do its best
                                to avoid and reduce the problems, which can arise from participation in gambling, particularly in cases of immoderate playing. At the same
                                time it is important to respect the rights of those who take part in games of chance to a reasonable extent as means of entertainment.</p>

                            <p>Responsible Gaming at Skyfair.vip is based on three fundamental principles: Security of the player, Security of the game and
                                Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research institutes, associations and therapy institutions, we work on creation of a
                                responsible, secure and reliable framework for online gaming.</p>

                            <p><strong>Player security</strong></p>
                            <p>We take responsibility for the security of our players. Protection of the players is based on forbidding the attendance of the minors from
                                participation in games and the protection of privacy, which involves responsible processing of personal data and payments. Fairness and
                                the random nature of the products offered are monitored closely by independent organizations. Marketing communication is also geared
                                towards player protection: we promise only what players can receive in our transparent line.</p>

                            <p><strong>Protection against gaming addiction: research – prevention – intervention</strong></p>
                            <p>The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and other gaming offers play in moderation for entertainment. Certain habits and
                                behavior patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or consumption of alcohol) which are considered to be normal and not causing
                                any concern can develop into addiction for some people and cause problems. In the same way, bets on sports and gambling can lead to
                                problems for a small group of customers.</p>
                            <p>Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further participation in the gaming line-up. Subsequently the customers are provided with
                                contacts of organizations where they can receive professional advice and support.</p>

                            <p><strong>Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention</strong></p>
                            <p>The basic principle promoted by Skyfair.vip is that the final decision and responsibility on whether to play or not, and how much
                                money can be spent on the game should be assumed by the customer himself.</p>
                            <p>Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most effective form of protection from addiction. Skyfair.vip sees its
                                responsibility in assisting the customers by providing transparent products, full information and keeping a clear line of conduct.</p>

                            <p><strong>Protection of minors</strong></p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to participate in games and make bets. That’s why the confirmation
                                of having reached the age of majority and the confirmation of date of birth are mandatory requirements during
                                registration. Skyfair.vip considers the issue of minors taking part in games and betting very seriously. In order to offer the
                                best possible protection of minors, we also rely on the support of parents and caregivers. Please keep your data for account access in a
                                safe place (user ID and password).</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter software. This software will allow you to restrict the access to Internet resources
                                inappropriate for children and teenagers.</p>

                            <p><strong>Responsibility towards problems</strong></p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip offers a variety of games and bets, which are forms of entertainment for the majority of customers. At the same time
                                the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing support and tools for maintenance of a secure and entertaining environment
                                taking into account the associated risks.</p>
                            <p>The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their own limits or those who suffer from gambling addiction are not able
                                to enjoy our product line-up responsibly and perceive it as a form of entertainment. Skyfair.vip takes responsibility for such
                                users by blocking their access to its products for their own protection.</p>

                            <p><strong>Get informed with the main issues!</strong></p>
                            <p>Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games within their financial capacity is fully acceptable. However, for a small
                                percentage of people gambling is not a form of entertainment, it is a challenge that must be considered seriously.</p>

                            <p><strong>What is the problematic game behavior?</strong></p>
                            <p>A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior, which interferes mode of life, work, financial position or health of a
                                person or his family. Long participation in games is counter indicative to such person as it can lead to negative consequences.</p>
                            <p>In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially recognized and enlisted in the list of psychological diseases of international
                                classification system DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is defined as long, repeating and frequently amplifying inclination for game, despite of
                                existing negative personal and social circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of family relations and delay of professional growth.</p>

                            <p><strong>In what cases behavior of a person should be considered as dependence?</strong></p>
                            <p>It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game dependence can be qualified only by experts. The material presented on this
                                web-page will help you to estimate and define your own game behaviour.</p>
                            <p>The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any substance is that it is very difficult to define the line between
                                pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there are some diagnostic signals that may point out the existing problems. In the presence of at
                                least five of the following symptoms, the likelihood of the severe dependence is high:</p>

                                <li>Bet sum increases in course of time.</li>
                                <li>Attempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear to be unsuccessful.</li>
                                <li>When limiting his participation in gambling, a person experiences irritation and disappointment.</li>
                                <li>The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.</li>
                                <li>The player tries to win back the lost amount,</li>
                                <li>Lies about his playing behavior,</li>
                                <li>Commits illegal acts,</li>
                                <li>Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,</li>
