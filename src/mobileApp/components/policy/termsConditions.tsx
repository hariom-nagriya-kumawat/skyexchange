                                in order to avoid a
                                liability legitimately incurred. You will reimburse us for any charge-backs, denial or reversal of
                                payment you make and any loss

                                was made; or clearly incorrect given the chance of the event occurring at the time the bet was made then

                                cancel or void that wager, or to cancel or void a wager made after an event has started.

                                mistake might be where a price is incorrect or where we enter a result of an event incorrectly. If there
                                are insufficient funds in
                                your Account, we may demand that you pay us the relevant outstanding amount relating to any erroneous

                                The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the event’s settlement; we do not recognise

                                decisions for wagering purposes. The result of an event suspended after the start of competition will be
                                decided according to the
                                wagering rules specified for that sport by us.
                            </p>

                                after results are posted, the company will only reset/correct the results due to human error, system
                                error or mistakes made by the

                                Customers are solely responsible for their own account transactions. Please be sure to review your
                                wagers for any mistakes before
                                sending them in. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be changed. We do not take responsibility for
                                missing or duplicate
                                wagers made by the Customer and will not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is missing or
                                duplicated. Customers may
                                review their transactions in the My Account section of the site after each session to ensure all
                                requested wagers were accepted.
                            </p>

                            <p>For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a Yes/No Proposition, the contestant must enter and
                                compete in the event.</p>

                            <p>
                                We attempt to follow the normal conventions to indicate home and away teams by indicating the home and
                                away team by means of
                                vertical placement on the desktop site version. This means in American Sports we would place the home
                                team on the bottom. For
                                Non-US sports, we would indicate the home team on top. In the case of a neutral venue, we attempt to
                                include the letter “N” next
                                to the team names to indicate this. For the Asian and mobile versions, we do not distinguish between
                                European and American Sports.
                                On the Asian and mobile versions of the site, the home team is always listed first. However, we do not
                                guarantee the accuracy of
                                this information and unless there is an official venue change subsequent to bets being placed, all
                                wagers have action.
                            </p>

                                A game/match will have action regardless of the League heading that is associated with the matchup. For
                                example, two teams from
                                the same League are playing in a Cup competition. If the matchup is mistakenly placed in the League
                                offering, the game/match will
                                still have action, as long as the matchup is correct. In other words, a matchup will have action as long
                                as the two teams are
                                correct, and regardless of the League header in which it is placed on our Website.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the governing body, then all wagers on the
                                event have no action. If an
                                event is posted by us, with an incorrect date, all wagers have action based on the date announced by the
                                governing body.

                                <li>May choose to delegate certain duties to other employees, but wherever such a delegation is made,
                                    the MLRO retains ultimate responsibility for the implementation of the compliance regime.
                                </li>
                                <li>At least annually, the MLRO will issue a report (the MLRO Report) to the senior management of
                                    SKYFAIR.VIP on the operation and effectiveness of the money laundering controls. This report will
                                    cover improvements, remedial programmes, the outcome of any internal audit reviews of the AML/CFT
                                    processes, and other relevant items.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.4 Compliance Policies and Procedures</p>

                            <p>Skyfair.vip has policies and procedures to assess the risks related to money laundering and terrorist
                                financing. These policies and procedures are:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Written and maintained by the MLRO under the supervision of senior management</li>
                                <li>Approved by senior management</li>
                                <li>Communicated, understood and adhered to by everyone dealing with customers or their transactions,
                                    including those who work in the areas relating to customer identification, record keeping, and
                                    reportable transactions, who need enough information to process and complete a transaction properly
                                    as well as to ascertain the identity of customers and keep records as required. </li>
                                <li>Policies and procedures which incorporate the reporting, record keeping, customer identification,
                                    risk assessment and risk mitigation requirements applicable.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Although directors and senior officers may not be involved in day-to-day compliance, they need to
                                understand the statutory duties placed upon them, their staff and SKYFAIR.VIP itself.
                            </p>

                            <p>15.4.1 The Risk-Based Approach</p>
                            <p>In money laundering and terrorist financing, a risk-based approach covers the following:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The risk assessment of customer relationships and business activities;</li>
                                <li>The risk mitigation to implement controls to handle identified risks;</li>
                                <li>Keeping customer identification, beneficial ownership and business relationship information up to
                                    date; and</li>
                                <li>The ongoing monitoring of business relationships and transactions.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Existing regulatory obligations, such as for customer identification, are a minimum baseline
                                requirement. Where enhanced due diligence is appropriate, a principle of the risk-based approach is to
                                focus resources where they are most needed to manage risks within our tolerance level.
                            </p>

                            <p>15.4.2 Risk Mitigation</p>

                            <p>Risk mitigation is implementing controls to limit the potential money laundering and terrorist financing
                                risks identified in the risk assessment so as to stay within the risk tolerance level. When the risk
                                assessment determines that risk is high for money laundering or terrorist financing, then we will
                                develop risk mitigation strategies and apply them.</p>

                            <p>In all situations, risk mitigation controls and measures include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Focussing on operations (products and services, customers and business relationships, geographic
                                    locations, and any other relevant factors) that are more vulnerable to abuse by money launderers and
                                    criminals;</li>
                                <li>Informing senior management of compliance initiatives, identified compliance deficiencies,
                                    corrective action taken, and suspicious transaction reports filed;</li>
                                <li>Providing for program continuity despite changes in management, employees or structure;</li>
                                <li>Focussing on meeting all regulatory record keeping and reporting requirements, recommendations for
                                    anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing compliance and providing for timely updates in
                                    response to changes in requirements;</li>
                                <li>Enabling the timely identification of reportable transactions and ensure accurate filing of required
                                    reports; </li>
                                <li>Incorporating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing compliance into job descriptions
                                    and performance evaluations of appropriate personnel; and
                                </li>
                                <li>Providing for adequate supervision and training of employees that handle currency transactions,
                                    complete reports, monitor for suspicious transactions, or engage in any other activity that forms
                                    part of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing program.</li>
                                <li>Increasing awareness of high risk situations within all business lines;</li>
                                <li>Increasing the frequency of ongoing monitoring of transactions or business relationships;</li>
                                <li>Escalating the approval of the establishment of an account or relationship even if not otherwise
                                    required to do so;</li>
                                <li>Increasing the levels of ongoing controls and reviews of relationships;</li>
                                <li>Requesting high-risk customers provide additional, documented information regarding controls they
                                    have implemented to safeguard their operations from abuse by money launderers and terrorists;</li>
                                <li>Verifying the identity of customers by reference to reliable, independent source documents, data or
                                    information;</li>
                                <li>Preventing any transaction with a potential customer until identification and account opening
                                    information has been obtained;</li>
                                <li>Implementing an appropriate process to approve all relationships identified as high-risk as part of
                                    the customer acceptance process or declining to do business with potential customers because they
                                    exceed Skyfair.vip’s risk tolerance level;</li>
                                <li>Implementing a process to exit from an existing high-risk relationship which management sees as
                                    exceeding Skyfair.vip ‘s risk tolerance level.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.4.3 Risk Assessment</p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip is required to and will analyse potential threats and vulnerabilities to money laundering and
                                terrorist financing to which the business may be exposed to in a risk assessment.</p>

                            <p>The risk assessment will document and consider the following:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Products, services and delivery channels </li>
                                <li>Geographic locations and areas of operation </li>
                                <li>Customers</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The risk assessment may identify high-risk situations for which risk mitigation controls and monitoring
                                may be required. The risk assessment is not static and will change over time.</p>
                            <p>When a customer is identified as high-risk, they are subject to more frequent ongoing monitoring and
                                updating of customer identification information, as well as any other appropriate enhanced measures.</p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip shall perform an initial risk assessment at the beginning of a new customer relationship and
                                for existing customers on an ongoing basis.</p>

                            <p>15.5 Client and Business Risk</p>

                            <p>15.5.1 Products, Services and Delivery Channels</p>

                            <p>SKYFAIR.VIP will identify products and services or combinations of them that may pose an elevated risk of
                                money laundering or terrorist financing. For example, products and services that support the movement
                                and conversion of assets into, through and out of the financial system pose a high risk. Certain
                                services have also been identified by financial regulators, governmental authorities or other credible
                                sources as being potentially high-risk for money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Wire transactions;</li>
                                <li>Transactions involving third parties;</li>
                                <li> Non-face-to-face business relationships.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.5.2 Geographic Locations and Areas of Operation</p>
                            <p>Certain geographic locations potentially pose an elevated risk for money laundering and terrorist
                                financing. These have been described by the FATF and by other resources such as Transparency
                                International. </p>
                            <p>Clients from, or identified as linked to these countries will be regarded as high risk:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Any country subject to sanctions, embargoes, or similar measures;</li>
                                <li>Any country identified by credible sources as providing funding or support for terrorist activities,
                                    or that have designated terrorist organisations operating within their country;</li>
                                <li>Any country known to be a tax haven, source of narcotics or other significant criminal activity;
                                </li>
                                <li>Any country identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as non-cooperative in the fight
                                    against money laundering or terrorist financing or subject to a FATF statement;</li>
                                <li>Any country identified by credible sources as lacking appropriate money laundering or terrorist
                                    financing laws and regulations, or as having significant levels of corruption.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>SKYFAIR.VIP does not do business with or provide services to anyone in any country belonging to a list of
                                select countries subject to comprehensive international sanctions.</p>
                            <p>15.5.3 Customer Relationships</p>
                            <p>The risk assessment requires to know your customers (“KYC”). This is not limited to identification or
                                record keeping, but it is also about understanding the customers – including their activities,
                                transaction patterns, and how they operate. </p>
                            <p>Examples of the factors that will be considered are:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>How long we have known the customer and had a business relationship;</li>
                                <li>Customers wanting to carry out large transactions;</li>
                                <li>Customers with regulatory or enforcement issues;</li>
                                <li>Customers with multiple online complaints;</li>
                                <li>Customers whose identification is difficult to verify;</li>
                                <li>Customers whose who are politically exposed. </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Each customer is risk-rated as either posing a low, medium or high risk of money laundering and/or
                                terrorist financing. The rating given at the beginning of the business relationship may be adjusted
                                after the re-assessment and may change over time. The level of customer due diligence will vary
                                depending on the risk rating of the customer at the beginning of the relationship and as it changes. For
                                all high-risk players, enhanced due diligence is applied right away.</p>

                            <p>15.5.4 Regulatory risk</p>
                            <p>Regulatory risk means not meeting our obligations under applicable legislation. Examples of breaches of
                                regulatory obligations include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Customer identification not done properly;</li>
                                <li>Failure to train staff adequately;</li>
                                <li>Bot having an anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) program;</li>
                                <li>Failure to report suspicious transactions;</li>
                                <li>Not having an MLRO;</li>
                                <li>Failing to keep complete customer records.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.5 Compliance Training</p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip has a training program for all relevant employees and other individuals who act on behalf of
                                the Company. The goal of this training is to make sure that those who have contact with customers, who
                                see customer transaction activity or who handle funds in any way understand the reporting, customer
                                identification and record keeping requirements.</p>
                            <p>All new employees of Skyfair.vip are required to complete anti-money laundering and terrorist financing
                                compliance training within their first three months of employment, and for customer-facing staff
                                training is delivered prior to dealing with customers.</p>
                            <p>Training is currently conducted through a customised course. The training program is delivered
                                electronically (via a learning management system). The training program is reviewed and updated by the
                                MLRO to reflect requirements as they change. The compliance training includes a test which everyone must
                                pass in order to consider their training complete.</p>
                            <p>To ensure employee training is kept up to date, all existing employees will receive follow up training on
                                new and existing AML and regulatory requirements on a regular basis (at least within one year of their
                                last training). If the online training test results show that a staff member does not understanding the
                                training material, SKYFAIR.VIP will ensure that the staff member receives specialised one-on-one
                                training to understand the material.</p>
                            <p>An employee log of assigned and completed training materials is kept by the MLRO and the Human Resources

                            <p>15.6. Minimum standards – KYC POLICY</p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip has established standards regarding Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”). These standards require due
                                diligence on each prospective customer before entering into a business relationship via identification
                                and verification of his identity and, as the case may be, his representatives and beneficial owners on
                                the basis of documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and independent source compliant
                                with the domestic and European AML/CFT legislation and regulation.</p>
                            <p>Interpretation of the KYC principle begins with identification of the customer by means of the necessary
                                identification documents.</p>
                            <p>That identification, completed by other information gathered, enables the Customer Acceptance Policy to
                                be applied.</p>
                            <p>In addition to these objective criteria, there are subjective elements which may arouse suspicions
                                regarding a customer and to which particular attention should be paid.</p>
                            <p>Finally, as KYC does not involve static data, but dynamic data through the relationship with the
                                customer, it also needs follow-up and ongoing monitoring of the customer.</p>

                            <p>15.6.1. Customer identification and verification (KYC)</p>
                            <p>The formal identification of customers on entry into commercial relations is a vital element, both for
                                the regulations relating to money laundering and for the KYC policy.</p>
                            <p>This identification relies on the following fundamental principles :</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Each customer (= each individual person and/or each person involved in the case of a legal entity)
                                    must be identified by means of original supporting documents.</li>
                                <li>These documents will be recorded in a centralised system.</li>
                                <li>The identification must be completed by "face-to-face" contact.</li>
                                <li>Distance identification is also authorised and possible within a dedicated acceptance process, but
                                    limits the opportunity to carry out certain transactions or to access certain products.</li>
                                <li>Each person identified must be registered by IT means.</li>
                                <li>A person will not be accepted as a customer if the identification process proves to be incomplete.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The specific case of the due diligence exercised on the acceptance of politically exposed persons
                                (PEP).</p>
                            <p>Concrete application at Skyfair.vip is reflected by a specific identification procedure for customers
                                referenced as PEP, whatever their place of residence.</p>
                            <p>15.6.2. Risk Profile calculation</p>

                            <p>To assist in determining the level of AML/CFT due diligence to be exercised with regard to the
                                Customer, a “Compliance” risk profile is calculated first of all on entry into relations (Low,
                                Medium, High), and is then recalculated daily.</p>

                            <p>15.6.3. Customer acceptance policy</p>
                            <p>15.6.3.1. Customer Identification</p>
                            <p>Client Identification is intended to confirm the existence and identify the individual with which
                                Skyfair.vip has a business relationship and obtain supporting identity information. This includes
                                measures to:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Confirm the existence of the individual through identification documents;</li>
                                <li>Conduct due diligence into the identity of the customer including:</li>
                                <li>Cross-referencing customer names against government watch lists;</li>
                                <li>Determining whether the customers are politically exposed persons;</li>
                                <li>Determining whether any third parties are involved;</li>
                                <li>Reviewing relevant publicly available information on the customer (e.g. adverse media, social
                                    media); </li>
                                <li>Reviewing their background, reputation;</li>
                                <li> Keep records of all information and documents obtained.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.6.3.2. Identifying Information for Customers </p>
                            <p>This section sets out the standard identification requirements for individuals who have entered into
                                a business relationship with SKYFAIR.VIP. This outline is likely to be sufficient for most
                                situations. If, however, the customer is assessed as presenting a higher money laundering or
                                terrorist financing risk, in line with our identified risk matrix, then SKYFAIR.VIP requires
                                additional identity information to be provided and increase the level or verification accordingly.
                            </p>
                            <p>Where the result of the standard verification check gives rise to concern or uncertainty over
                                identity, the number of matches that will be required to be reasonably satisfied as to the
                                individual’s identity will increase. Any concerns must be reported to the MLRO.</p>
                            <p>If a customer is unable to produce a primary ID, the reasons for this should be noted and they may
                                not be able to maintain an account.</p>
                            <p>All documentary evidence must be recent.
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li> Passports and drivers’ licenses should be valid and not expired</li>
                                <li>Utility bills should be dated within the last 3 months</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>In terms of beneficial ownership, we will ask every customer whether they are acting in their own
                                capacity or on behalf of another person. If they are acting for another person then we will require
                                details of such.</p>
                            <p>Sources of evidence </p>
                            <p>Proof of Identity - Acceptable photo identity:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Valid passport; or</li>
                                <li>Valid photo card driving licence (full or provisional); or</li>
                                <li>National identity card (non-UK nationals issued by EEA member states and Switzerland);or</li>
                                <li>Identity card issued by the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Proof of Identity - Acceptable non-photo evidence of identity:</p>
                            <p>Documents issued by a government department, incorporating the person’s name and residential address
                                or their date of birth. E.g. (for proof of address or date of birth):</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Instrument of a court appointment (such as a grant of probate, bankruptcy); or</li>
                                <li>Current council tax demand letter or statement; or</li>
                                <li>Current (within the last 3 months) bank statements, or credit/debit card statements issued by a
                                    regulated financial sector firm in the UK, EU or equivalent jurisdiction; or</li>
                                <li>A recent (last available) utility bill (gas, water, electricity, telephone); it must be a bill
                                    or statement of account (not correspondence); statements printed off the internet are not
                                    acceptable on their own (a secondary check will be required such as a reference to a telephone
                                    directory including an online telephone directory); or</li>
                                <li>Valid photo card driving licence (full or provisional); or</li>
                                <li>A solicitor’s letter confirming recent house purchase or land previous address.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>When accepting evidence of identity from a customer, it is important that we make sufficient checks
                                on the evidence provided to satisfy us of the customer’s identity, and that we keep a record of the
                                checks made. This will be done by the MLRO or under the supervision of the MLRO.</p>
                            <p>Usual checks on photo ID may include:</p>
                            <p>Likeness against the customer</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Does the date of birth on the evidence match the apparent age of the customer?</li>
                                <li>Is the ID valid? </li>
                                <li>Is the spelling of names the same as other documents provided by the customer? </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Checks on secondary evidence of ID may include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Do the addresses match the address given on the photo ID?</li>
                                <li>Does the name of the customer match with the name on the photo ID?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.6.3.3. Identity Verification Triggers </p>
                            <p>Verification of the identity of the customer occurs either when the customer has reached the €2,000
                                threshold or if the player is considered to be a high-risk player upon registration. The main
                                trigger for Identity Verification is considered a single transaction (or smaller, linked
                                transactions) that reach or exceed €2,000 either at deposit or withdrawal stage. For example,
                                transactions will be considered as linked when they are carried out by the same customer during a
                                single period of being logged on to the SKYFAIR.VIP website or if they are carried out in 48 hours.
                            </p>
                            <p>In all cases, the customer will receive a notification to upload identity verification documents
                                listed above. Each document that is provided by customers to SKYFAIR .VIPis checked manually by
                                dedicated staff.</p>
                            <p>Further events that may trigger Identity Verification processes:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>When a customer requests a withdrawal to a different account than one that was used to make a
                                    deposit (e.g. due to the fact that certain payment service providers do not support incoming
                                    payments or other reasons). In these cases, the withdrawal requests will be immediately deducted
                                    from the customer’s account, however, will not be processed until the customer’s identity has
                                    been verified to ensure that the funds are going to the right person;</li>
                                <li>When a customer makes multiple deposits within a short timeframe (five or more deposits in one
                                    hour);</li>
                                <li>Staff identifies suspicious deposit patterns and or several payment cards are used (three or
                                    more different payment methods used within one week);</li>
                                <li>Registration country and IP do not match – In such cases, the player account may not be blocked
                                    and the player may still make deposits and play games, however, no withdrawal will be allowed
                                    until verification has been carried out;</li>
                                <li>When a deposit exceeds €5,000.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Copies will be kept of all the documents used for identification.</p>
                            <p>15.6.3.4. Additional Documents</p>
                            <p>Additional documents may be requested from customers to substantiate their activities or to better
                                understand their patters:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Proof of Bank Account – This may be a screenshot or copy of the bank statement stating the
                                    customer’s name and IBAN and the name of the bank (for instances when a customer requests a
                                    withdrawal to be deposited to a bank account);</li>
                                <li>Proof of Payment Card – This may be a photo or copy of the front side of the card in question or
                                    a bank statement that will include both the card details and the name of the customer (for
                                    instances when suspicious deposit patters are identified) –</li>
                                <li>To protect the customer’s card data, SKYFAIR.VIP informs them that they may obfuscate some of
                                    the card details, however, the customer’s name, as well as the first and last four digits of the
                                    card number must be visible.</li>
                                <li>Bank Statements and Payslips – These may be requested from customers displaying potentially
                                    problematic gambling patterns and when external information available on the customer does not
                                    validate the amounts being gambled. In such cases SKYFAIR.VIP would ask its higher volume
                                    customers for documents which would support the funds being spent on gambling.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.6.3.5. Mitigation of Impersonation Risk</p>
                            <p>Various additional customer identity checks are permitted on a risk-based approach. These checks may
                                include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s name with an
                                    EU/EEA regulated credit institution or one from an equivalent jurisdiction;</li>
                                <li>Verifying additional aspects of the customer’s identity, or of their electronic ‘footprint’;
                                </li>
                                <li>Telephone contact with the customer prior to opening the account on a home or business number
                                    which has been verified (electronically or otherwise) or a call to the customer before further
                                    transactions are permitted, using it to verify additional aspects of personal identity
                                    information that have been previously provided during the setting up of the account;</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.6.3.6. Keeping Information Up-to-Date</p>
                            <p>Once the identity of a customer has been confirmed, it does not have to be confirmed again. However,
                                if there is any doubt about the information held, then that identification will be obtained again,
                                including the identification of the customer.</p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip may review the customer documentation and then update it as appropriate. Any changes to
                                identification such as a change of name of the customer would require new documents to be obtained.
                            </p>

                            <p>15.6.4. Ongoing transaction monitoring</p>
                            <p>There are certain automated controls in place to monitor customer activities, for example:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>First time deposits;</li>
                                <li>Cash-out alerts for cash-outs greater than €1,000;</li>
                                <li>Activity alerts when customer pays to, or stakes with the casino €2,000 during any period of 24
                                    hours;</li>
                                <li>Credit Card BIN alerts (when Credit Card country differs from player account country/IP);</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>In addition, all cash-out requests are processed manually by the Payments Team and are reviewed on a
                                daily basis. Every request undergoes security checks before approval in order to determine that the
                                origin of the funds/wins is compliant with the Gaming Control Board Curacao Policy and the terms and
                                conditions of the Company.</p>
                            <p>15.7. Organization of internal control</p>
                            <p>Any member of Skyfair.vip can report suspicious activities to the MLRO, as Skyfair.vip’s Nominated
                                Officer. A suspicious activity is one where it is known, or suspected, there are reasonably grounds
                                to know or suspect that a person is engaged in, or attempting, money laundering or terrorist
                                financing.</p>
                            <p>15.7.1. Suspicious transactions reporting</p>
                            <p>Having knowledge means knowing something to be true. Knowledge can be inferred from the surrounding
                                circumstances; so, for example, a failure to ask obvious questions may imply knowledge. The
                                knowledge must, however, have come to Skyfair.vip during the course of business, or from a
                                disclosure (to the MLRO).</p>
                            <p>Suspicion is more subjective and falls short of proof based on firm evidence. Suspicion is more than
                                speculation and is based on some foundation.</p>
                            <p>An unusual transaction is not necessarily suspicious. Unusual patterns of gambling, including the
                                spending of particularly large amounts of money in relation to the casino or customer’s profile,
                                should receive attention, but unusual behaviour should not necessarily lead to grounds for knowledge
                                or suspicion of money laundering, or the making of a report to the FIAU. The MLRO is required to
                                assess all of the circumstances and, in some cases, it may be helpful to ask the customer or others
                                more questions. The choice depends on what is already known about the customer and the transaction,
                                and how easy it is to make enquiries.</p>

                            <p>Members of staff who consider a transaction or activity to be suspicious, would not necessarily be
                                expected to know or to establish the exact nature of any underlying criminal offence, or that the
                                particular funds or property were those arising from a crime, money laundering or terrorist
                                financing. “Reasonable grounds to know or suspect” introduces an objective test of suspicion. The
                                test is likely to be met when there are facts or circumstances, known to the member of staff, from
                                which a reasonable person (in a payments firm) would have inferred knowledge, or formed the
                                suspicion, that another person was engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
                            <p>A defence of failing to meet the test of suspicion, would be for staff to demonstrate that they took
                                reasonable steps to know the customer and the rationale for the transaction, activity or
                                instruction.</p>
                            <p>15.7.2 How to Make a Suspicious Activity Report</p>

                            <p>Any member of staff, who is suspicious that a transaction may involve money laundering or who becomes
                                aware during the course of their work that someone else is involved in money laundering, must make a
                                disclosure to the MLRO using the Skyfair.vip Suspicious Transaction Report form.</p>
                            <p>Once completed, the form should be printed off. The member of staff making the report must sign and
                                date the form before giving it to the MLRO. The MLRO will take note of the date and time of report
                                receipt.</p>
                            <p>Upon receipt of the form by the MLRO, they will then decide what is to be done as a result of the
                                report, e.g., whether the matter must be reported to Gaming Control board, Curacao. or not, or
                                further enquiries made and record its decision and the reason for it in the customer files. The
                                member of staff concerned must be informed of the decision and the reasons for it.</p>
                            <p>If the matter is to be referred to GCB, the MLRO or a subordinate will complete the FIAU report form
                                and discussing with the reporting member of staff how matters with the customer are to be conducted
                                from that stage. The GCB report form must be signed off by the MLRO or the CEO. </p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip must not proceed with a transaction whilst we await consent from the concerned from GCB
                                it is given 7 working days (not including weekends or bank holidays) to consider the report.</p>
                            <p>If we hear nothing then we may continue with the transaction but not inform the customer about the
                                report. GCB may give consent to proceed earlier than this time limit. They may also refuse consent
                                in which case they have a further 31 calendar days (including weekends or bank holidays) to further
                                consider the report. After this they must either begin proceedings or allow the transaction to
                                continue.</p>
                            <p>The MLRO will submit a softcopy version of the report to the GCB. Any paper file for each matter will
                                be kept by the MLRO. </p>
                            <p>There must be no record on the customer file or on the computer system which refers in any way to
                                suspicious activity reporting, money laundering, etc., to avoid the risk of tipping off. It is a
                                criminal offence to inform a customer that a SAR has been submitted, or to inform them of an
                                investigation into their affairs.</p>
                            <p>All records of SARs will be kept in the central reporting file, which is kept by the MLRO.</p>

                            <p>15.7.3 How to Identify Suspicious Activity</p>
                            <p>Transactions may give reasonable grounds to suspect that they are related to money laundering or
                                terrorist activity financing regardless of the sum of money involved. There is no monetary threshold
                                for making a SAR. Suspicious transactions may involve several factors that on their own seem
                                insignificant, but together raise suspicion that the transaction is related to the commission or
                                attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence, or both. As a
                                general guide, a transaction may be connected to money laundering or terrorist activity financing
                                when we think that it (or a group of transactions) raises questions or gives rise to discomfort,
                                apprehension or mistrust. </p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip will examine, as far as reasonably possible, the background and purpose of all complex,
                                unusual large transactions, and all unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent
                                economic or lawful purpose.</p>
                            <p>The context in which the transaction occurs or is attempted is a significant factor in assessing
                                suspicion and this will vary from one customer to another.</p>
                            <p>Transactions will be evaluated in terms of what seems appropriate and is within normal practices in
                                business and based on our knowledge of the customer. The fact that transactions do not appear to be
                                in keeping with normal industry practices may be a relevant factor.</p>
                            <p>Reasonable evaluation of relevant factors, including the knowledge of the customer's business,
                                financial history, background and behaviour is the basis of assessing suspicion. Behaviour is
                                suspicious, not people. We have listed below some indicators to help with this assessment.</p>

                            <p>15.7.4 Indicators of Suspicious Transactions</p>
                            <p>Certain products, services, activities or channels may pose a higher risk of misuse for money
                                laundering. Listed below are several anti-money laundering risk indicators or “red flags” that might
                                be grounds for suspicion. The list is not exhaustive and not conclusive but will be used as a guide
                                for inquiry and follow-up, alongside other material.</p>
                            <p>A single indicator does not necessarily indicate reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering or
                                terrorist financing activity. However, if several indicators are present during one or a series of
                                transactions, then we will take a closer look at other factors before deciding whether the
                                transaction must be reported.</p>
                            <p>In the case of a transaction aborted in the belief that the property is owned or controlled by or on
                                behalf of a terrorist or a terrorist group, then there must be a terrorist property report. If there
                                are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to an attempted commission of a
                                terrorist activity financing or money laundering offence, then a suspicious transaction report about
                                the attempted transaction is also required.</p>
                            <p>Becoming aware of certain indicators could trigger reasonable grounds to suspect that one or more
                                transactions from the past (that had not previously seemed suspicious) were related to money
                                laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
                            <p>15.7.4.1 Application and Identification</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Information mismatch from application</li>
                                <li>Application information/address/customer differs from initial registration</li>
                                <li>Inability to provide government issued identification details</li>
                                <li>Change of address to high-fraud area or to problematic jurisdiction, shortly after the
                                    application </li>
                                <li>Lack of reliable third party and/or governmental verification of individual</li>
                                <li>The address indicated (or corroborated) is identified as mail drop or other high-risk address,
                                    as opposed to a physical street address</li>
                                <li>Transaction volume, deposits, and cash-outs are inconsistent</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>15.7.4.2 Account Settlement</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Large, cross-border wire transfer payments</li>
                                <li>Settlements/partial settlements from unrelated third parties</li>
                                <li>Excessive/ongoing large credit refunds</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>15.7.4.3 Transaction and Customer Monitoring</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Stakes wagered by a customer become unusually high or out of the ordinary and the customer is
                                    believed to be spending beyond his or her known means. This requires some knowledge of the
                                    customer but, nevertheless, there may be circumstances that appear unusual and raise the
                                    suspicion that he is using money obtained unlawfully.</li>
                                <li>It may be that the customer lives in low cost accommodation with no known source of income but
                                    nonetheless is spending money well above his or her apparent means.</li>
                                <li>There is no set amount which dictates when a SAR should be made and much will depend on what is
                                    known, or suspected, about the customer.</li>
                                <li>A customer exhibits unusual gambling patterns with an almost guaranteed return or very little
                                    financial risk. </li>
                                <li>It is accepted that some customers prefer to gamble in this way but, in some instances, the
                                    actions may raise suspicion because they are different from the customer’s normal gambling
                                    practices.</li>
                                <li>Money is deposited by a customer or held over a period and withdrawn by the customer without
                                    being used for gambling. </li>
                                <li>For instance, suspicions should be raised by any large amounts deposited in gaming machines or
                                    gambling accounts that are then cashed or withdrawn after very little game play or gambling.
                                </li>
                                <li>A customer regularly gambles large amounts of money and appears to find a level of losses
                                    acceptable. </li>
                                <li>In this instance, the customer may be spending the proceeds of crime and sees the losses as an
                                    acceptable consequence of the process of laundering those proceeds.</li>
                                <li>A customers spend increases over a period of time, thereby masking high spend and potential
                                    money laundering. </li>
                                <li>A customer spends little, but often, and his annual aggregate spend is high and out of kilter
                                    with his expected spend. </li>
                                <li>A customer displays gambling patterns where spend is high but the risk is low, for example
                                    gambling on red and black in roulette. The customer could be laundering money in a way that
                                    guarantees minimal loss. </li>
                                <li>Instances of high spend by customers that lead to significant commercial risk for the operator
                                    may also indicate suspicious activity.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Indicators to help establish suspicion that a transaction may be related to a terrorist activity
                                financing offence mostly resemble those relating to money laundering, although there are some
                                differences. For example, amounts relating to terrorist financing generally may be smaller.</p>
                            <p>15.7.4. Financial Sanctions</p>
                            <p>It is the policy of Skyfair.vip to verify the identity of all customers, and to check that they are
                                not the subject of sanctions or other statutory measures prohibiting the Company from providing its
                                services. The member of staff conducting verification of identity will complete the process by
                                checking that the customer is not the subject of sanctions or other statutory measures, using the
                                screening methods set out by the MLRO. These include the direct questions to the prospective
                                customer, screening of all new customers against sanctions and other databases (via direct reference
                                to an official list or using a commercially available product), and ongoing screening of all
                                customer names (via ongoing subscription to commercially available products and automatic uploads).
                            </p>
                            <p>15.7.5. Adverse Media</p>
                            <p>Along with Sanctions and PEP databases, third-party providers offer a service that screens
                                individuals for adverse media. Skyfair.vip uses such a service to identify if a customer has been
                                identified by the media as having links to financial crime, terrorist financing and/or other
                                criminal activity. These individuals, once confirmed to be one and the same in both media and among
                                the SKYFAIR customers, would only be allowed to continue using SKYFAIR.VIP services after a close
                                review by the MLRO and/or senior management.</p>
                            <p>15.8. Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing </p>
                            <p>As an extension to the AML/CFT efforts, Skyfair.vip also employs Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing
                                Policies and Procedures. These are standalone documents that are available to all employees and are
                                part of their onboarding package.</p>

                            <p>Skyfair.vip is committed to establish and maintain procedures which enable it to be satisfied as to
                                the integrity of all new staff members and by extension their likeliness to follow the SKYFAIR.VIP
                                policies and procedures. To meet this requirement, the Human Resource Department is responsible for
                                undertaking all of the checks listed in relation to new members of staff and for retaining the
                                appropriate records:</p>

                            <p>
                                Skyfair.vip is committed to endorsing responsible wagering among its customers as well as promoting
                                the awareness of problem gambling and improving prevention, intervention and treatment.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Skyfair.VIP’s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its commitment to minimizing the negative effects
                                of problem gambling and to promoting responsible gambling practices.
                            </p>

                            <p>Skyfair.VIP supports the generation of online gamblers offering them a wide range of games and
                                entertainment. We also take responsibility for our product line-up.
                            </p>
                            <p>The aim of Skyfair.vip is to provide the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform for
                                adults. The offered clear and safe products allow each user to play within his financial means and
                                to receive the highest quality service. Integrity, fairness and reliability are the guiding
                                principles of Skyfair.vip’s work. It is therefore clear that Skyfair.vip should do its best to avoid
                                and reduce the problems, which can arise from participation in gambling, particularly in cases of
                                immoderate playing. At the same time it is important to respect the rights of those who take part in
                                games of chance to a reasonable extent as means of entertainment.
                            </p>

                            <p>Responsible Gaming at Skyfair.vip is based on three fundamental principles: Security of the player,
                                Security of the game and Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research institutes,
                                associations and therapy institutions, we work on creation of a responsible, secure and reliable
                                framework for online gaming.</p>
                            <p>Player security</p>
                            <p>We take responsibility for the security of our players. Protection of the players is based on
                                forbidding the attendance of the minors from participation in games and the protection of privacy,
                                which involves responsible processing of personal data and payments. Fairness and the random nature
                                of the products offered are monitored closely by independent organizations. Marketing communication
                                is also geared towards player protection: we promise only what players can receive in our
                                transparent line.</p>
                            <p>Protection against gaming addiction: research – prevention – intervention</p>
                            <p>The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and other gaming offers play in moderation
                                for entertainment. Certain habits and behavior patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or
                                consumption of alcohol) which are considered to be normal and not causing any concern can develop
                                into addiction for some people and cause problems. In the same way, bets on sports and gambling can
                                lead to problems for a small group of customers.</p>
                            <p>Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further participation in the gaming line-up.
                                Subsequently the customers are provided with contacts of organizations where they can receive
                                professional advice and support.</p>
                            <p>Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention</p>
                            <p>The basic principle promoted by Skyfair.vip is that the final decision and responsibility on whether
                                to play or not, and how much money can be spent on the game should be assumed by the customer
                                himself.</p>

                            <p>Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most effective form of protection from
                                addiction. Skyfair.vip sees its responsibility in assisting the customers by providing transparent
                                products, full information and keeping a clear line of conduct.</p>
                            <p>Protection of minors</p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to participate in games and make
                                bets. That’s why the confirmation of having reached the age of majority and the confirmation of date
                                of birth are mandatory requirements during registration. Skyfair.vip considers the issue of minors
                                taking part in games and betting very seriously. In order to offer the best possible protection of
                                minors, we also rely on the support of parents and caregivers. Please keep your data for account
                                access in a safe place (user ID and password).</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter software. This software will allow you to
                                restrict the access to Internet resources inappropriate for children and teenagers.</p>
                            <p>Responsibility towards problems</p>
                            <p>Skyfair.vip offers a variety of games and bets, which are forms of entertainment for the majority of
                                customers. At the same time the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing support
                                and tools for maintenance of a secure and entertaining environment taking into account the
                                associated risks.</p>
                            <p>The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their own limits or those who suffer
                                from gambling addiction are not able to enjoy our product line-up responsibly and perceive it as a
                                form of entertainment. Skyfair.vip takes responsibility for such users by blocking their access to
                                its products for their own protection.</p>
                            <p>Get informed with the main issues</p>
                            <p>Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games within their financial capacity is
                                fully acceptable. However, for a small percentage of people gambling is not a form of entertainment,
                                it is a challenge that must be considered seriously.</p>
                            <p>What is the problematic game behavior?</p>
                            <p>A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior, which interferes mode of life, work,
                                financial position or health of a person or his family. Long participation in games is counter
                                indicative to such person as it can lead to negative consequences.</p>
                            <p>In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially recognized and enlisted in the list of
                                psychological diseases of international classification system DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is defined as
                                long, repeating and frequently amplifying inclination for game, despite of existing negative
                                personal and social circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of family relations and delay of
                                professional growth.</p>
                            <p>In what cases behavior of a person should be considered as dependence?</p>
                            <p>It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game dependence can be qualified only by experts.
                                The material presented on this web-page will help you to estimate and define your own game
                                behaviour.
                            </p>
                            <p>The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any substance is that it is very
                                difficult to define the line between pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there are some diagnostic
                                signals that may point out the existing problems. In the presence of at least five of the following
                                symptoms, the likelihood of the severe dependence is high:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>The player is deeply involved in gambling, all his thoughts are only about the game.</li>
                                <li>Bet sum increases in course of time.</li>
                                <li>Attempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear to be unsuccessful.</li>
                                <li>When limiting his participation in gambling, a person experiences irritation and disappointment.
                                </li>
                                <li>The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.</li>
                                <li>The player tries to win back the lost amount,</li>
                                <li>Lies about his playing behavior,</li>
                                <li>Commits illegal acts,</li>
                                <li>Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,</li>
